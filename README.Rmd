# MSOrganiser

MSOrganiser is created to provide users a convenient way to extract 
and organise MRM transition names data exported from mass spectrometry 
software into an Excel or csv file in a few button clicks.

With the addition of the MSTemplate_Creator, the software is also able to 
normalize the peak area with respect to the internal standardâ€™s peak area 
as well as calculate the concentration of the analytes. 

It is currently distributed as platform independent source code under
the MIT license.
